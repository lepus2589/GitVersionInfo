# GitVersionInfo #

This CMake module contains macros for triggering rebuilds on Git status changes
and providing the latest Git SHA1 hash as compile definition.

## Prerequisites ##

What you need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional) for getting the code and contributing
  to the project
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) for building
  the project

### Linux (Ubuntu) ###

Use your distribution's package manager to install the necessary packages:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build
```

### Mac OS X ###

You will need one of the community package managers for Mac OS X:
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php). For installing one of these,
please refer to their respective installation instructions.

#### Homebrew ####

```shell
$ brew install cmake ninja
```

#### MacPorts ####

```shell
$ sudo port -v install cmake ninja
```

### Windows ###

The easiest thing to do is using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and follow the
Linux instructions above.

Otherwise, install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) for version
control and [cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html), which is a large
collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a
Linux distribution on Windows. During the `cygwin` installation you'll be
prompted to add additional packages. Search and select the following:

- `cmake` and `ninja` for the build system

After `cygwin` finishes installing, use the cygwin terminal to start the build
process.

## How to build ##

1. Clone the git repository or download the source code archive and unpack it to
   an arbitrary directory (e.g. `git-version-info`).
2. Go to this directory and type `cp ./CMakeUserPresets.template.json
   ./CMakeUserPresets.json`.
3. Next, type `cmake --workflow --list-presets`. A list of available build
   workflows will be shown to you.
4. For configuring, building and installing the project, type `cmake --workflow
   --preset user-install`. This will populate the `./build` directory with a CMake
   configuration tree, execute the build and install the project. By default,
   the configured installation directory is `./install`.

   You can specify a different install location by setting the
   `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable in the `"user-config"` preset in your
   `./CMakeUserPresets.json`:

   ```json
      "cacheVariables": {
         "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX": "$env{HOME}/.local"
      }
   ```

   Please refer to the [CMake Documentation about presets][1] for further details.

5. For running the tests, type `cmake --workflow --preset user-test`.

## How to use ##

With the `GitVersionInfo` module installed, you can use it in other projects.
The installed `GitVersionInfo` package is discoverable by CMake as
__GitVersionInfo__. In the `CMakeLists.txt` of the other project, do the
following:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    GitVersionInfo
    GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/lepus2589/GitVersionInfo.git"
    GIT_TAG v1.0.0
    SYSTEM
    FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS 1.0.0 CONFIG NAMES GitVersionInfo
)
set(GitVersionInfo_INCLUDE_PACKAGING TRUE)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(GitVersionInfo)
```

This discovers an installed version of the GitVersionInfo module or adds it to
the other project's install targets. To help CMake discover an installed
GitVersionInfo package, call CMake for the other project like this:

```shell
$ cmake -B ./build -D "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/GitVersionInfo/install/prefix"
```

Replace the path to the GitVersionInfo install prefix with the actual path on
your system! If GitVersionInfo is installed in a proper system-wide location,
the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` shouldn't be necessary.

In the other project's package config CMake file, you can now use the module like this:

```cmake
find_package(GitVersionInfo REQUIRED CONFIG)
include(GitVersionInfo)

git_version_info_add_dependants(target_to_rebuild)
```

The `find_package()` command adds the GitVersionInfo module to the
`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` variable which enables the `include()` by name only.
